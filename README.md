# MARVEL-API-PROJECT
 The code is an example Python script that uses the Marvel API to randomly select and retrieve information about Marvel characters whose names start with a given letter of the alphabet. It retrieves information about the total number of events, series, and comics associated with each character and stores this information in separate lists.
