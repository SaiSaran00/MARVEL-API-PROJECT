Marvel API Character Retrieval
This repository contains Python code that retrieves random Marvel comic book characters from the Marvel API based on a randomly chosen letter of the alphabet. It uses the public and private keys from the Marvel API to generate an MD5 hash and create a URL to send a request to the API. The code extracts various data fields from the JSON response, including the character name, ID, number of available events, series, and comics. The retrieved character data is stored in a list, and the code loops 30 times to retrieve a new character each time. This code can be used to explore and retrieve character data from the Marvel API for research, data analysis, or other purposes.
